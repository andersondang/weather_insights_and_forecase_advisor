## API Integration Testing

### ⚠️ Backend Connection (Not Tested)

**Status:** Frontend compiled successfully, but backend agent not running

**API Endpoints Expected:**
- `POST /query` - Main agent query endpoint
- Session management with `session_id`

**Mock Data Currently Used:**
- Forecast: Hardcoded 7-day forecast for Miami
- Alerts: 3 sample alerts (Hurricane, Flood, Heat Advisory)
- Risk Analysis: Hurricane evacuation priority data
- Resources: Shelter and hospital listings

**To Test Backend Integration:**
```bash
# Start backend agent
cd /Users/cvsubramanian/CascadeProjects/graphrag/agents/agents_for_impact/weather_insights_and_forecast_advisor
# Need to activate virtual environment and run: adk web

# Frontend will connect to http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Performance Testing

### ✅ Build & Compilation
- [x] React app compiles successfully
- [x] Tailwind CSS processes correctly
- [x] No critical errors
- [x] Minor ESLint warnings (unused variables - non-blocking)

**Build Time:**
- Initial compilation: ~26 seconds
- Hot reload: < 2 seconds

**Bundle Size:** (Production build not tested)
- Would need to run `npm run build` to check

---

## Accessibility Testing

### ✅ Basic Accessibility
- [x] Semantic HTML elements used
- [x] Button elements for interactive components
- [x] Form labels present
- [x] Color contrast sufficient for text
- [x] Icons have descriptive purposes

2. **Test Backend Integration:** Start agent and verify API calls
3. **Add Loading States:** Improve UX during API calls
4. **Error Handling:** Add user-friendly error messages

### Short-term Enhancements
1. **Map Integration:** Implement Leaflet for interactive maps
2. **Charts:** Add Recharts for hourly forecast visualization
3. **Real Data:** Connect to live NWS API and Google Maps API
4. **Accessibility:** Complete WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Performance:** Implement code splitting and lazy loading
2. **Testing:** Add Jest unit tests and Cypress E2E tests
3. **PWA:** Add service worker for offline support
4. **Analytics:** Track user interactions for UX improvements
